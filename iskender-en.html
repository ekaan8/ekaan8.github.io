            i believe that seeing others as competitors — along with the responsibility and obsession that comes with it — distracts us from what we truly need to focus on.
            most of the memories and moments that stay with us throughout life come from doing something purely for its own sake.
            examples might include singing music, creating a work of art, or building an exceptional product.
            when we do these things simply for their own value, the concept of time seems to disappear — we begin to merge with what we’re doing.
            we first imagine the act, then we move forward like a ship filled with inspiration and thought — yet it’s not us who truly set the course, but the sea beneath us.
            that’s why, in my view, the greatest and most meaningful works, memories, and acts of heroism are born when the creator and the creation become one.
            they merge because there are no rigid lines, no clear boundaries between them. and that’s why they cannot be conquered — they can only be discovered.

                <br><br>alexander the great is arguably the greatest king of all time, because you can’t truly separate him from a soldier or a traveler. everything he did — his campaigns, his journeys, his conquests — was not only for the sake of reaching a goal, but for the path itself.
                after conquering persian lands and turning his gaze further east, he reached the indian subcontinent. there, he fought armies filled with war elephants, and after barely surviving the brutal battle of hydaspes — which he won, but almost died in — he looked even farther: toward the endless unknown, toward the ocean.
                yet his soldiers and generals, weary from years of harsh battles and longing for home, wanted to return. alexander initially wished to push further east, but he couldn’t fulfill that desire and was forced to turn back.
                but here’s where we must shift our perspective: was there truly an “east” left for alexander at that point? i don’t think so — for the east had already been reached, already been conquered. at that point, borders, familiar words, and traditional tactics began to dissolve, and a new reality emerged.
                if alexander had continued, every step he took would have become a *new* east. but perhaps no one saw this more clearly than alexander himself — and that’s precisely why he couldn’t go any further.
                on the journey home, alexander grew so furious that he led his army through the gedrosian desert in the south of persia — even though easier paths existed. he chose instead to inflict a kind of punishment.
                i love telling this story, because by then, alexander no longer had any rivals. he had defeated darius, subdued countless tribes, brought satraps to heel. and when borders disappear, who remains as a rival but oneself? he had none — yet he couldn’t defeat himself.
                still, that doesn’t mean we should remember him only as a king. he was also a traveler. and perhaps because he had no true rival, even centuries later, people of vastly different cultures and religions still revere him as a legendary figure.

                muslims wrote *iskendernames* in his name and even identified him with dhu al-qarnayn. when caesar served rome in his early years in spain, he stood before a statue of alexander and wept, ashamed that he had not achieved as much. and for many others, he has always remained the king at the very top.
                when alexander reached the edges of the indian ocean and the old world’s borders had already begun to dissolve, perhaps he could have been reborn in a different form — if he had truly destroyed the old-world mindset within his own army. that is, if he had been able to let go of his own soldiers.
                of course, it’s wise to avoid speaking in certainties about such things, which is why i use words of possibility. my goal here isn’t just to offer a brief historical tale about alexander, but rather to use him as a way to return to the path i started from.
                what can someone with a real rival truly gain in the long run? doesn’t seeing others as rivals inevitably lead to either winning or losing? is our goal to win something or to sustain it?
                i said earlier that real joy comes when we do things purely for their own sake. but someone with a rival — are they really doing what they do for the sake of the thing itself?
                why is alexander so great? isn’t it precisely because he pursued conquest for the sake of conquest itself?
                was darius truly his rival, or merely a peak he needed to surpass?
                those who see others as rivals build boundaries for themselves. i don’t know whether these boundaries are visible or invisible, nor what kind of impact they have — but how can we explore anything in a place where boundaries exist?
                boundaries are either overcome or remain in place — but does such a structure truly contain within it the essence of infinity or greatness? i don't believe it does.
                that’s why there’s no need to create rivals or imagine victories defined by them.
                if there’s anything we must overcome, it should be ourselves.
                if something must be destroyed and then reborn through new creation, it must also be ourselves.

                steve jobs and his team transformed the music industry from the ground up with the ipod, making themselves the dominant force in the field. the entire market shifted, and if you were a music producer, signing a deal with apple became the most profitable path.
                but in such an environment, steve jobs had to extinguish his own torch — because the future he foresaw was greater than the past he had shaped.
                what should one do in such a moment? find new rivals and try to build bigger torches than theirs? or design something that will light up the world according to the shape of the coming future?
                personally, i support the second. and i believe steve jobs did too — which is why the company he built with wozniak is now bigger than many nations.
                but to make that leap, he had to kill his own product — the ipod — and create the iphone instead. what if he had clung to familiar boundaries, traditional methods, or existing rivals? perhaps he would have tried to keep the ipod market alive by force and attempted to conquer the future with outdated tools.
                but instead, he chose to *discover* the future — to shape it the right way.
                i believe this is one of the things that keeps figures like alexander, caesar, and steve jobs alive in our collective memory. they had no true rivals, and they pursued their work out of deep passion for the work itself.
                they dissolved time, erased borders, dismissed competitors — and left us a world not to be conquered, but to be discovered.
