            <h1>the future in arm architecture</h1>
        </div>
        
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>
we may be able to change our global approach to the architectures underlying the human-computer relationship.
arm architecture dominates the mobile space and has a significant share in servers,
but its presence in computers is still low—almost the opposite of its position in mobile.
i believe that when designing the architecture of computers (including phones, tablets, and other devices),
we should prioritize computers. in my view, the process of satisfying human expectations through general performance
should be secondary, because human adaptation to these tools can always be developed later.
we can think of this as our approach to addressing speed issues when building a tool.
            </p> 
            <div class="image-wrapper">
                <img src="arm1.png" alt="Vizyonumuz" class="ilke-image">
                <p class="golden-ratio-text">arm architecture and areas of use</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>  
at its core, speed is an important factor, but it can always be improved later, and it belongs to the rapidly accelerating side of a natural process.
if we trust our ships, this is a sea that's easy for us to cross. i like to use the following example to better explain this:
during the early development of computers, there were many different models. some were based on electronic systems, while others were primarily mechanical.
some were fast, some were slow; some could be reprogrammed, while others couldn’t be programmed at all.
but in the end, the computers that advanced were the programmable ones (like the eckert-mauchly computer, eniac).
this is because the fundamental priority was given to the computer itself. perhaps programmable computers were slower than their competitors,
but speed can always be overcome—we’re not trying to exceed the speed of light. in tools, mechanical systems, and gears,
we can always discover something new for speed because it offers a predictable vision. in these areas, we don’t really need creative leaps.

                <br>
                the relevance of this topic to the arm system, which uses an advanced risc architecture, is as follows: the vast majority of computers today still rely on intel-based x86 architecture. however, this is a system that burdens computers and consumes a lot of energy. since it was built on such foundations, it can’t easily be changed later. no matter how much faster it gets, it ends up demanding more energy, generating more heat, requiring more expensive cooling systems, and creating devices that are harder to carry or even touch—ultimately resulting in environments that are less comfortable for users.

in terms of performance, even now, the arm architecture doesn’t operate exactly like x86 in every area—and that’s actually x86’s biggest advantage. but here’s what i think we really need to recognize: just like speed, performance is also built on fundamental metrics. we don’t always need creative breakthroughs or leaps to improve it—progress is already embedded in its nature. however, once we design a system in a way that later reveals major incompatibilities, we find ourselves unable to change it, nor can we reduce the enormous resources spent trying to optimize it.

<br><br>i believe the risc architecture will be the savior—across nearly all domains. x86 can still serve as a fundamental solution for high-performance needs, but isn’t it time to shift it toward more specialized use cases? i think x86 should still be significantly used in areas like nasa’s complex visualization systems and simulation programs, or in major film studios’ high-computation film rendering workflows. but for most of the world, we need to transition to devices based on risc architecture.

the most common counterargument is that arm architecture still can’t deliver the high-end performance required to run games—but i believe this is a solvable problem.

            <div class="image-wrapper1">
                <img src="risc2.png" alt="shell" class="ilke-image1">

            <p>
                <br>

                the primary focus of the arm architecture is to provide high efficiency with low power consumption while simplifying the interaction between hardware and software. it achieves this by allowing machine code to be processed more simply and efficiently, optimizing operations at the kernel level. efficient kernel performance is something we already want, as it enhances the overall stability and performance of the operating system running on it. from that point on, the improvement directly affects the user experience. since it prioritizes computers and devices at its core, i think it has greater potential for growth—perhaps it requires a long journey, but reaching the goal is almost certain because i see this development method as natural. once the stage of creative inspiration and forward leap is accomplished, the rest of the progress is likely to happen very quickly.
            </p>

            <div class="image-wrapper1">
                <img src="forecast1.jpg" alt="shell" class="ilke-image2">
            </div>
            <p>
                <br>
                areas where arm architecture is currently insufficiently used include games for primary users and, somewhat later, software like modeling or simulation programs. however, all these issues stem not only from architectural limitations but also from software and design incompatibilities. these incompatibilities are quite solvable because the main requirement now is no longer manpower but time. as i mentioned before, if problems like speed and time arise, they can definitely be overcome somewhere, as long as the foundation is solid and predictable. i find the foundation of the arm architecture very strong and predictable because its instruction set is simple, clear, and fast.
                going forward, i believe significant steps should be taken to address incompatibility issues in games and widely used applications. globally, the share of computers using risc architecture should increase even more for primary users.
